This library implements a java classes to represent the elements of the InkML standard as it is defined by the W3C in a working draft.

The library is not thought to work stand-alone, but can be integrated in other application. Originally it was developed to access the InkML files of the IAMonDo database, a set of online handwritten documents containing differrent form of content. This database was created at the Institute of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics (IAM) of the University of Bern

For now a large subset of the InkML standard is implemented, but this may be extended to implement the whole definition in the future.
